## 2.3.0 (2024-05-07)

> [!WARNING]
> Starting with this release, the app will be shipped as two `.exe` files (`SII_Decrypt.exe` and `tpc.exe` respectively).
> `SII_Decrypt.exe` is required for the app to work properly. Make sure it is in the same directory as `tpc.exe` and that it is not renamed.
>
> For now you have to download `SII_Decrypt.exe` manually, but the next version will automatically download it for you.
